def powerlaw_psd_gaussian(exponent, size, fmin=0):
    """Gaussian (1/f)**beta noise.

    Based on the algorithm in:
    Timmer, J. and Koenig, M.:
    On generating power law noise.
    Astron. Astrophys. 300, 707-710 (1995)

    Normalised to unit variance

    Parameters:
    -----------

    exponent : float
        The power-spectrum of the generated noise is proportional to

        S(f) = (1 / f)**beta
        flicker / pink noise:   exponent beta = 1
        brown noise:            exponent beta = 2

        Furthermore, the autocorrelation decays proportional to lag**-gamma
        with gamma = 1 - beta for 0 < beta < 1.
        There may be finite-size issues for beta close to one.

    size : int or iterable
        The output has the given shape, and the desired power spectrum in
        the last coordinate. That is, the last dimension is taken as time,
        and all other components are independent.

    fmin : float, optional
        Low-frequency cutoff.
        Default: 0 corresponds to original paper. It is not actually
        zero, but 1/samples.

    Returns
